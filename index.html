            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="./assets/images/self-pic.png" class="profilePic" alt="me">
            <p>Born in the shadow of an erupting volcano, I trained in the ways of nature learning to bend the elements to my will and change my form into animals. I have faced the nefarious Dragon Cult and prevented the rise of Tiamat, Mother of Dragons. I have entered the twisting, mysterious passageways of White Plume Mountain and returned to tell my tale... 
                <br>in Dungeons & Dragons. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In my more mundane real life, I was born on a military base in Darmstadt, Germany (in the shadow of Frankenstein's castle! not really.) I am a 28 year old artist and writer. I graduated <span>summa cum laude</span> from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a Bachelor's in English.  I have worked in youth programs, marijuana dispensaries and a literary arts magazine. I am a proud Wiccan.</p> 
                <br>
                <p> With the help of the Goddess I am seeking a new path in life. Interested in learning how to code and expanding my career opportunities, I enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver. This site is an exercise I am undertaking to advance my skills in HTML and CSS.
